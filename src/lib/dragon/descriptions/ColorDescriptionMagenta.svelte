<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Magenta Dragons</h3>
<p>
	There are rumors of magenta dragons living among us in secret, kept safe by their memory-modifying
	magical powers. Whether or not they truly exist in your setting, conspiracy theories about their
	existence almost certainly do. A magenta dragon (real or theoretical) might infiltrate an enemy
	government from the inside, maintain a sanctuary for those with powerful enemies, or work as an
	enigmatic assassin whose murders never seem to have any witnesses.
