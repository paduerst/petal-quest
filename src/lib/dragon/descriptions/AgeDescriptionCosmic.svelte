<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Cosmic Dragons</h3>
<p class="mb-2">
	Cosmic dragons are generally in the last decade of their life. They are so suffused with magical
	power that they are now immune to nonmagical weaponry. This great power has begun to exceed the
	limits of their mortal form; they can no longer safely change their shape into beast or humanoid
	forms. Attempting to do so—or taking too much damage—causes them to enter their cosmic form: a
	supernova. While in their supernova form, the dragon undergoes a catastrophic series of explosions
	that ends with their destruction. The dragon can attempt to reconstitute themself as an action,
	potentially exiting their cosmic form and halting their supernova for now.

	At the end of their natural life span, a prismatic dragon "goes nova" irreversibly. It is
	impossible to end this final supernova and save the dragon from their death.
