<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Cosmic Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Cosmic dragons are generally in the last decade of their life. Their power has begun to exceed the
	limits of their mortal form. They can no longer safely change their shape into beast or humanoid
	forms; attempting to do so causes a series of explosions that ultimately ends with their
	destruction.
