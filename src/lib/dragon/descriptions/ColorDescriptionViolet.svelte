<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Violet Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Orderly to a fault, many violet dragons would rule the world with an iron fist and a stack of
	paperwork if they could. A violet dragon might be found working as a pro-bono lawyer, defending a
	major city under siege, or plotting the demise of their sister who is first in line for the
	throne.
