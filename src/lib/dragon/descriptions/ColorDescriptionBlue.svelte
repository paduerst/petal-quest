<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Blue Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Blue dragons are often fascinated by the thrill of new discovery, especially in the realm of
	science and magic. A blue dragon might be found running a magical university, performing social
	experiments on unsuspecting humans, or methodically testing whether teleportation into the sun is
	possible.
