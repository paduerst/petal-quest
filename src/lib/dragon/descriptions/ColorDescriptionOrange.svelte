<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Orange Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Orange dragons are taught from a young age to think militarily, assessing anything as a potential
	threat. They also place a high value on the discipline of mastering a craft. An orange dragon
	might be a general on the battlefield, a world-renowned chef, or a beloved blacksmithing teacher.
