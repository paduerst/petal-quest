<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Yellow Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Yellow dragons value knowledge and wit above all else, and are especially concerned with creating
	and preserving records. A yellow dragon might be found teaching at the local public school,
	stealing archeological wonders for their private hoard, or maintaining an ancient hidden library
	in the Border Ethereal.
