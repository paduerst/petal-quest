<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Indigo Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Indigo dragons are described in tales as terrifying sea serpents, emerging from the ocean depths
	to petrify and sink unsuspecting sailors. Whatever humanoids say about them, these often
	hard-to-read dragons can have varied motivations and goals. An indigo dragon might be the captain
	of a notorious band of pirates, the curator of a suspicious statue museum, or the guardian of a
	tropical island and its surrounding coral reef.
