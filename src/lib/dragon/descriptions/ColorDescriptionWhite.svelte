<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic White Dragons</h3>
<p>
	White dragons live short, explosively powerful lives. They are extremely rare and die before
	reaching 200 years of age, but they almost always leave a significant mark on the world, for
	better or for worse. A white dragon might be the champion defender of an empire during a great
	war, the terrible tyrant that burns a civilization to the ground, or the prophet of a new and
	fast-spreading religion.
