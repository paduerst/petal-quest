<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic White Dragons</h3>
<p>
	White dragons are born from divine intervention or when 3 or more prismatic dragons from across
	the ROYGBIV spectrum have wyrmlings together. White dragons live short, explosively powerful
	lives. They are extremely rare and die by the age of 150, but they almost always leave a
	significant mark on the world, for better or for worse. A white dragon might be the champion
	defender of an empire during a great war, the terrible tyrant that burns a civilization to the
	ground, or the prophet of a new and fast-spreading religion.

{#if includeAgeParagraph}
	<p class="mt-2">
		White dragons age 10 times faster than other prismatic dragons. They are a wyrmling for just 1
		year, and they reach adulthood by the age of 10. They become ancient at the age of 100 and are
		cosmic for the last year of their life.
