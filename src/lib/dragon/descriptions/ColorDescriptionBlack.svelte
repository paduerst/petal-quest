<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Black Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Black dragons are born when any prismatic dragon egg hatches during a total solar eclipse. As such
	they are the rarest of the prismatic dragons. A black dragon might be found trying to escape the
	cult that forced their birth, running a hospital which develops quality-of-life-focused medical
	approaches, or living a life of solitude in a hidden corner of the world.

{#if includeAgeParagraph}
	<p class="mt-2">
		Black dragons age half as fast as other prismatic dragons. They are a wyrmling for 20 years, and
		they reach adulthood at the age of 200. They become ancient at the age of 2000 and are cosmic
		for the last 20 years of their life. Instead of becoming a supernova, their cosmic form is that
		of a singularity: an implosion so great that light cannot escape.
