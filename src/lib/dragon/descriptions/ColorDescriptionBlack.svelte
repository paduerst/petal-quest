<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Black Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Black dragons are born when any dragon egg hatches during a total solar eclipse. As such they are
	the rarest of the prismatic dragons, but their lifespan is seemingly indefinite, with the oldest
	known black dragon nearing 3000 years old. A black dragon might be found trying to escape the cult
	that forced their birth, running a hospital which develops quality-of-life-focused medical
	approaches, or living on a secluded mountain to avoid the throngs of people seeking lifespan
	extension.
