<h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Prismatic Green Dragons</h3>
<p>
	Green dragons, the protectors of nature, are the most in touch with the land. The indefinite sleep
	breath of adult and ancient green dragons has also fueled countless legends about them. They might
	be found tending an herb garden in a treacherous mountain pass, negotiating for the establishment
	of a nature preserve, or building an army of sleeping adventurers to get revenge on a nearby city.
