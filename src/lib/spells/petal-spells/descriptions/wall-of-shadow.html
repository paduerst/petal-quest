	A plane of opaque shadow forms a vertical wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch
	thick—centered on a point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall into a
	sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose within range. If you position the
	wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails, and your action
	and the spell slot are wasted.
</p>
<p>
	The wall dims light within 60 feet of it, turning bright light into dim light and dim light into
	darkness.
</p>
<p>
	The wall remains in place for the duration, but it can be destroyed early by dealing at least 25
	radiant damage to it.
</p>
<p>
	You and creatures you designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through the wall without
	harm. When another creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, the creature must
	make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
	much damage on a successful one.

	<b><i>At Higher Levels.</i></b>
	When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6
	for each slot level above 3rd. When you use a spell slot of 9th level, the wall is unaffected by
	<i>dispel magic</i> and <i>antimagic field</i>.
